            Objectives
        </h2>
        <p>Big Data analytics has been transforming industry and
        science in various domains for the past few years, making
        possible the processing of Terabytes of data on a daily
        basis. This was enabled by the joint evolution of
        programming models, data-analysis algorithms and computing
        infrastructures.</p>
        
        <p>This course introduces the concepts and some of the main
        algorithms used for Big Data analytics. It presents the
        principles of the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Spark, and it
        details the main algorithms for the analysis of large
        datasets, related to similarity search, mining of frequent
        itemsets, graph analysis, clustering, stream mining,
        recommender systems and advertising.</p>
    
        <p>By the end of this course, students will be able to write
          and deploy efficient parallel algorithms to analyze Big Data
          sources for various applications.</p>

        </span></a>
        Communication
    </h2>
    <p>
    Important information will be communicated through Moodle and/or Slack.
    Students are expected to consult these channels regularly.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://moodle.concordia.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=124458">Moodle page</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tgteacher.slack.com/messages">Slack workspace</a> (join channel #bigdata--winter2020)</li>
    </ul>
    Students are also encouraged to communicate about course topics between
    themselves, with their TAs, and with the professor. Frequent
    communication is key to successful learning! However, to ensure a
    viable environment, the following rules must be respected, in
    particular for communications happening on Slack:
    <ul>
      <li>Spend a few minutes searching for answers on your own before asking 
        other people. 
      </li>
      <li>Keep an eye on the on-going discussions, and try to avoid asking
      a question that has already been asked.</li>
      <li>Use Slack's thread feature to follow-up on a question instead of
      posting replies to the main channel.</li>
      <li>Don't hesitate to chime in a discussion if you think you might help.</li>
      <li>Always use the public channel (#bigdata--winter2020) to ask your
      questions. In particular, never exchange private messages with your
      TA. If any personal matter has to be discussed, communicate with the
      professor. If you really need to send a non-public message to your
      TA, always involve the professor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    These rules are meant to ensure that most questions could be answered while keeping a 
    reasonable load on the instructors.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the instructors are dedicated to providing a
    harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
    identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate
    harassment of students or TAs in any form. Sexual language and imagery
    is not appropriate for any communication, in particular on Slack. For
    more information, please consult <a

  Course Evaluation
</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Lab assignments (30%)</strong>: You will be required
      to develop data analysis programs in Python using Apache
      Spark or Dask. There will be a total of four assignments. You must
      work on these assignments <strong>individually</strong>. The
      lab assignments are all due on a Friday evening, 11:55pm
      (see exact dates on the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>
      table). A grace period of 48 hours will be automatically
      granted (assignments will be accepted until Sunday night,
      11:55pm), but <strong>no further extension will be
        granted</strong>. Assignments must be submitted through
      GitHub Classroom, you will receive a link for each assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exams (40%)</strong>: There will be a mid-term and a 
      final exam. Exams will be closed-book. The midterm will be 
      conducted in-class and will count for 10% of the final grade. The 
      final exam will count for 30% of the final grade. However, if the 
      result of the final exam is better than the result of the 
      mid-term (as a percentage out of 100) then the weight of the 
      mid-term will be shifted to the final exam. In general, you will 
      need to bring your own ENCS calculator. There will be no 
      substitution for a missed exam. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Project (30%)</strong>: The project should fall in one of the following 3 categories:
      <ul>
        <li><u>Dataset analysis</u>: select a dataset (for instance
        from your research) and apply at least two techniques seen
        in the course using Apache Spark, Dask or scikit-learn. You are not
        required to re-implement these techniques, but you need to discuss and interpret the results.</li>
        <li><u>Technology evaluation</u>: perform a comparative
        study of at least two open-source technologies related to
        Big Data Analysis, for instance from
        the <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop
        project</a>.</li>
        <li><u>Algorithm implementation</u>: (Re-)implement at least two
        algorithms seen in the course or related to the themes
        seen in the course.
      </ul>
    <p>
      No project template will be provided: you are supposed to define 
      your own project based on the instructions above. If you are 
      doing a Master or PhD thesis, you are strongly encouraged to 
      define a project based on your own research. Other types of 
      (relevant) projects are welcome and can be discussed with the 
      instructor during office hours or on 
      Slack, or with the TAs during the lab sessions.  You have to work 
      on the project in <strong>teams of 3</strong>. The project has to involve substantial software development, released on GitHub.
       The project will 
      have the following milestones. Deadlines are indicated on
      the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>. No deadline extension
      will be granted.
      <ol>
          <li>The <strong>project registration (1%)</strong> will simply declare the team of 3 students that will work on the project. No team
          update will be accepted after the registration.</li>
          <li>The <strong>project GitHub repository (1%)</strong> will be a
          public or private GitHub repository containing the software,
          results and report of the project. If the repository is private,
          you must authorize GitHub user "glatard" to access it. All the
          subsequent milestones have to be submitted through your GitHub
          repository. In particular, the project proposal and report will be
          written in the README.md file in the repository. At this stage,
          your README file must contain a 100-word abstract of the project.
           </li>
          <li> The <strong>project proposal (3%)</strong> will be a
          revision of the README.md file in your project GitHub repository, with the following structure:<ul>
            <li>Abstract (100 words)</li>
            <li>I. Introduction (300 words): context, objectives, presentation of the problem to solve, related work.</li>
            <li>II. Materials and Methods (400 words): the dataset(s), technologies and algorithms that will be used.</li>
          </ul>
        Even though the project proposal is only worth 3% of the final grade, you are
        strongly encouraged to take it seriously as it is your
        chance to get formal feedback on the project before the
        final deliverables. Besides, the grade obtained for the project
        proposal is a good predictor of the grades obtained for
          the project report and presentation.
        </li>
        <li> The <strong>project report (15%)</strong> will be a
          revision of the README.md file in your project GitHub repository, with the following structure:
          <ul>
        <li>Abstract (100 words)</li>
        <li>I. Introduction (300 words): context, objectives, presentation of the problem to solve, related work.</li>
        <li>II. Materials and Methods (400 words): the dataset(s), technologies and algorithms that will be used.</li>
        <li>III. Results (300 words): a description of the result of the
        study (dataset analysis, technology comparison or
        implementation), with quantitative data obtained by
        the project team (graphs, tables, metrics, etc).</li>
        <li>IV. Discussion (300 words): a discussion of the relevance of
        the solution(s), of the limitations and of possible
        future work.</li>
          </ul>
          Project proposals and reports will be evaluated using the following
          criteria:
          <ul>
        <li>Originality (choice of the dataset, technology, problem) (10%)</li>
        <li>Clarity (writing, organization, formatting) (20%)</li>
        <li>Relevance to the course topics (10%)</li>
        <li>Technical quality, including code comprehensiveness and quality (60%)</li>
          </ul>
          All criteria will be assessed on a 4-level scale: unacceptable, average, good, excellent. 
        <li>The <strong>project presentation (10%)</strong> will be a 5 to 10-minute presentation of the project. It will be evaluated using the following
          criteria:
          <ul>
        <li>Clarity (slides and speech) (2%)</li>
        <li>Relevance (2%)</li>
        <li>Technical quality (6%)</li>
          </ul>
          Expect 1 or 2 questions after your presentation.  All criteria will be assessed on a 4-level scale: unacceptable, average, good, excellent. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Grading Scheme</strong>: A passing mark on each of the 3
      deliverables (lab assignments, exam and
      project) is required to get a passing grade for the course.  There
      is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades
      assigned. The grading of the course will be done based on the relative
      percentages assigned to the assignments, project and the exam. There is no
      definite rule for translation of number grades to letter grades.
